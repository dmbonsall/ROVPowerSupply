<h1>ROV Power Supply</h1>
<h2>A 1400W DC/DC converter for use with underwater Remotly Operated Vehicals (ROV)</h2>
<p>This power supply was designed to convert 48VDC to 12VDC and 5VDC for use in the MATE ROV competionion. It uses multiple DC/DC converters from Murata Power to perform the power conversions.</p>
<p>There are two versions of this power supply. The first supply is a simple version which only includes the converter modules and a handful of passives. The second version is a "smart" version which includes an arduino pro mini that interacts with the converter modules to monitor the state and power output of the 12V power modules.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly our team lost funding before this could be manufactured, however the hardware design is complete and has been successfully passed a design/electrical rule check provided by Texas A&M University. A BOM for each version is provided with manufacturer and vendor part numbers.</p>
